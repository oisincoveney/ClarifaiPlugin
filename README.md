# ClarifaiPlugin
A wrapper for the Clarifai REST API

The ClarifaiTagger class can be used as a wrapper for the Clarifai Image prediction engine, and get away from the somewhat nasty
notation that Clarifai uses in their own prediction search engine. The class reduces many chained methods into three simple
processes: adding, calculating, and returning the tags from Clarifai.
